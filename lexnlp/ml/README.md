### `lexnlp.ml.catalog.CATALOG`

LexNLP stores downloaded data (Scikit-Learn pipelines, training corpora, etc.) in the `CATALOG` directory.
By default, `CATALOG` refers to the subdirectory `lexpredict-lexnlp` within NLTK's data directory (`nltk_data`).


### `lexnlp.ml.catalog.download`

Public functions:

`download_github_release(tag: str, prompt_user: bool = True) -> None`

    Downloads a GitHub release from the release repository, optionally confirming
    download behavior with a human user.

    If `prompt_user == True`:
        1. Prompt user for download [Y/n]
        2. If [Y], fetch file size
        3. Ask user if downloading file size is acceptable [Y/n]
        4. If [Y], download file

    Args:
        tag (str):
            The GitHub release tag to download.
        prompt_user (bool=True):
            Whether to prompt the user before downloading.

Downloaded files are written to the `CATALOG` directory.

### `lexnlp.ml.normalizers`



The `Normalizer` class searches for and replaces substrings in input text.

It is initialized with an iterable of tuples. Each tuple should contain a function which takes a string as input and yields a subclass of `lexnlp.extract.common.annotations.text_annotation.TextAnnotation`:

```python
Callable[[str], Generator[TextAnnotation, None, None]]
```
The second element of each tuple should be a replacement string.

Usage:

```python
>>> from lexnlp.ml.normalizers import Normalizer

>>> normalizer: Normalizer = Normalizer(
...     normalizations=(
...         (get_ratio_annotations, '__RATIO__'),
...         (get_date_annotations, '__DATE__'),
...         (get_percent_annotations, '__PERCENT__'),
...         (get_amount_annotations, '__AMOUNT__'),
...     ),
... )

>>> normalizer(text='7% is due on 2022-01-01')
'__PERCENT__ is due on __DATE__'

```

### `lexnlp.ml.gensim_utils`

`lexnlp.ml.gensim_utils.TrainingCallback` is used for printing Gensim training information. Read more here: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/callbacks.html
        

```python
doc2vec_model: Doc2Vec = Doc2Vec(
    ...,
    callbacks=(TrainingCallback(),)
)
```

`lexnlp.ml.gensim_utils.DummyGensimKeyedVectors` is a drop-in replacement for Gensim's `KeyedVectors` and is useful for reducing file size.

Note: models must be saved with `cloudpickle`, or DummyGensimKeyedVectors must be imported before a model loaded from disk. 

```python
doc2vec_model.dv = DummyGensimKeyedVectors(doc2vec_model.dv.vector_size)
```

### `lexnlp.ml.predictor`

Subclasses of `lexnlp.ml.predictor.ProbabilityPredictor` should use a Scikit-Learn Pipeline to transform input and make classification predictions.

---

### `lexnlp.ml.vectorizers`

Classes in this module form vector representations of strings.
